What does the word "PASSION" means? Does it means only feeling interested in something? Or feeling like getting involved in some field you dream of? I used to have the same idea. But one man, my teammate Hua, has totally changed my mind toward passion, with his words and actions: the so called PASSION, means you insist on doing the best in the field you love, despite whatever terrible condition and however what other think.
	The story began in a dim mood. As the Robot Team in our school, we had worked for the competition for a year. However, the result was not satisfying at all. We took a tour to a brother school with our robot just 3 days before the national competition, and was totally defeated. Lacking money to build up the robot, we had just fixed up our robot, and had the taste of lost. Compared with the robot of our brother school, our robots feels like a heap of junk. And our confidence and hope sank to the bottom. The most depressed people must be us programming section, since the structure couldn't be changed within only 3 days, and the only thing that could be improved was the program.
	After returning to our own school, feeling hopeless, I turn on my laptop and worked on it, while I had nothing in my mind but failing. I had the imagination of being an idiot in the game. I found it difficult to think, and decided to fix the bug, which is boring but needs least thinking. Tell the truth, I've given up privately. That's the only thing I could do, I think. Just after a few minutes, Hua jumped to me and said, "With such a strategy, we might have no chance to win." "Uh hum." I nodded numbly, "But what could you do to change it? Don't forget it, there's only 3 days left." He smiled excitedly, and replied, "Without trying, how can you make sure you can't do that? Anyway, as the time is short, we could burn the night oil." Then he just started to create a new project, fetched a piece of draft paper and said, "Brainstorm it, if you are making a new framework, what would you do?"
	After two nights' burning night oil, finally we made it to refresh the strategy and framework. In the third evening, we were both too tired to work so we make a decision to take turn to debug. Gratefully, I said, "Without your leadership, we couldn't have it done." He smiled again, peaceful but serious, "We should do our best to avoid accidental error tonight, which means we could not relax, for now." No anxiety was shown on his face from the beginning to the end. He just smile at you warmly like sunrise, and keep asking you how could make the thing better. His face swelled, and I bet, so did mine, because of extreme exhaustion. And at that time, suddenly, I come to realize what passion truly was. Passion is steady confidence and fierce desire to enjoy it and do better!
	Waken up by Hua, whose face was oily and hair was messy, I came to discover my own passion. Trembling my hands, I checked the wires. Struggling against closing eyes, I coded the program. Leaning to the pole, I observed the robot. Empty of strength but content in my heart, I threw myself just after waking Hua up for his turn. Having no words but reports of the improvements and newly-occurred bugs, having no dream but getting a better score in the later competition, we continued to work. The sun rose at about 6 p.m., when sunshine spray through the window framework, leaving net-like shadows on the ground and poles. And the robot went through the shadow, gaining one and another points. We looked into the other's face. In fact, we seemed to be street men who had been beate--black gear oil on the fingers, swollen face, messy hair...etc. However, either of us was smiling, enjoying the achievement which was not easy to gain.
	Later in the morning, after other teammates who were in charge of transportation wrapped the robot into boxes, we set out to Beijing. On the plane, we had the best sleep among those three day. In our battlefield, we had tried our best.
